
-----------------------------------------------
This documnet list the initial steps in cloning a git repo, adding changes to the local repo,
commitng changes and pushing to it back
-----------------------------------------------

Note: This doc assumes you have github account already

1. Create a ssh key. On your linux machine type in the following command 
   
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your@email.com"

   -- First, get your key from the file; the terminal will have told you where the key was stored; open the file, 
   -- copy the key (be careful not to add any newlines or white-space). Open your GitHub account page, 
   -- scroll to SSH Public Keys, and click “Add another public key.” Paste in your key and save it. 
   -- You’re good to go! You can test your authentication by running this:

      ssh git@github.com

Note: If you have a ssh key already with you simply copy the key to your account on github

2. Forking a repo and cloning it to your local machine

   -- On github website search for a repo, On the righ side you have a option to fork the repo.
   -- Go back to your account and you can see this repo being forked
   -- In the right sidebar of your fork's repository page, click  to copy the clone URL for your fork. 
   
   -- On your local machine issue this command git clone <url you have copied>
   -- This would create clone 

3. Adding files, changes to the cloned copy

   -- Let say you have adde a file into the cloned repo on your local machine or made changes to the code
   -- In order to add these files/folders/changes, cd <to the repo> and then issue the command
        
          git add .   --> This will add the files, but not commit

   -- In order to commit the changes, issue the command
     
          git commit 
          
4. Push your changes to your forked repo (not the original repo)

   -- Now that you have commited changes to the cloned repo on your local machine, you need to push these to the github
      forked repo

   -- to do this issue the following command
      
      git push   --> This will prompt you for you github usrname and password

   -- You can see the changes made in your repo on local machine to be reflected on the your github forked repo


5. To make your source code pulled by original fork, you have to send a pull request to the project owner.

   -- Go to the web page of your forked project on GitHub.

   -- Hit the pull request button on the top right of page

   -- Select the commits that you want to submit by change commits button.

   -- Write some description of your changes, comments, or etc.

   -- Send pull request and wait for the owner reply.
